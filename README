Title : Mass Transit Ticketing Machine Using SystemVerilog
Problem statement
The goal of this project is to design and implement a finite state machine (FSM) for a mass transit ticketing machine using SystemVerilog.
Abstract
This paper presents the design and implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) for a mass transit ticketing machine using SystemVerilog. 
The machine accepts Rs.10/- and Rs.20/-, dispensing a ticket once the total reaches Rs.50/-, and returning all bills if the total exceeds Rs.50/-, without providing change. 
The FSM is designed to transition through four primary states. The state transitions are driven by clock signals and controlled through combinational logic, ensuring the system's reliability and efficiency. 
This implementation demonstrates the practical application of FSM concepts in digital system design, providing a robust solution for automated ticket vending in mass transit systems.
